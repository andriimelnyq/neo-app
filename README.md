# NEO APP
[DEMO](https://andriimelnyq.github.io/neo-app/)

This application shows a list of elements with information about near orbital objects (NEO). The list has a maximum of 6 elements. Every 5 seconds, a new element is added to the list, providing aggregated data for a single day. If the list is already full, the oldest element is removed to accommodate the new element. A red background color applies to the two highest numbers of hazardous objects to visually highlight the elements. This background color is dynamically updated with each new element added to the list.
